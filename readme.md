## Help
* **What's years?** For this calculator I am converting every 365 days (see wishlist).

##To do:
- [ ] Implement the eligibility rules
- [ ] Include Australian rule of 67 years
- [ ] UX: Treat the last empty entry for NZ date range as current date?
- [ ] Calculate the date when you'd be eligible with certain assumptions (that you continue living/contributing in the "current" country)


## Wishlist:

- [ ] Check dates for overlaps
- [ ] Treat the years in a facy way: each year is day to (same day - 1) in the next year (except for 29 Feb, it may be treated as 28 Feb when it's not leap year). The difference is days. Any set of remainders of days can be then added to 365 to count as a year.
    * 1 year = 01 Mar 2020 - 28 Feb 2021
    * 1 year = 29 Feb 2020 - 27 Feb 2021
    * 1 year = 01 Mar 2019 - 29 Feb 2020
    * 1 year = 31 Mar 2019 - 30 Mar 2019
